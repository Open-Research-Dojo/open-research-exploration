# Open Research

Open research is research conducted in the spirit of free and open-source software. Much like open-source schemes that are built around a source code that is made public, *the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results extracted or derived from them*. This permits a massively distributed collaboration, and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.
