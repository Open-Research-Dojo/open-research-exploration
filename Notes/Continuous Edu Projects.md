# Continuous Edu Projects

Many student projects dissapear by the end of the semester in the trashbin. This finite lifetime seems to have an effect on fun, experiencing the real need, and transferabillity. We think that by letting students working on long running projects (for a few years) that are meaningfull (solving an issue for a real customer), provide a much richer learning experience, and brings an experience that is very close to real practice.
